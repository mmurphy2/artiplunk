Installation Configuration
--------------------------
There are two ways that the installation can be configured. In the simple
case, a configuration file is passed as the single [argument] to the
Artiplunk installer. This configuration file may be plain text (in Bash
script format) or symmetrically encrypted using GPG. Alternatively, the
configuration (plain or GPG encrypted) may be packed into the installer
itself at the "config" internal path. To install with a packed
configuration, use the -P [option].
