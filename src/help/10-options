Options
-------
  -c <directory>   --cache <directory>
    Use the specified <directory> as the installer cache, instead of the
    default /tmp/artiplunk

  -C   --clean
    Performs the cleanup steps from a previously terminated installation,
    including unmounting file systems and removing the cache directory.

  -d   --debug
    Enables debugging messages.

  -D   --dry-run
    Instead of actually performing the installation, display the commands
    that would be run on the target system.

  -e <step>   --end-step <step>
    Stop the installer once <step> is complete. Note that cleanup actions will
    NOT be performed.

  -h   --help
    Show this help message and exit.

  -k <step>   --skip-step <step>
    Skip a <step> in the installation process. To skip more than one step,

    target system at the end of the install process.

  -O   --copy-artiplunk
    Make a copy of Artiplunk, with the installation configuration packed into
    it, inside /root on the target system. The installer will be named
    /root/artiplunk-hostname, where hostname will be the hostname set for

    this packed installer can be used with the -P option.

  -p   --pack

    Install using a configuration packed into this script at the internal

    Artiplunk configuration files. This step installs the proper editor.

  -r   --resume

    Mount an installed system to permit manual repairs. This option is
    equivalent to -S mount

  -s <step>    --start-step <step>
    Start the installation process at <step>, instead of at the beginning. If
    used with -r, resumes from the specified <step>.

  -S <step>    --step <step>
    Peforms one <step> of the installation process, then stops. Does NOT
    perform cleanup operations.

  -u <item> --unpack <item>
    Unpacks an item (internal help or template) from the installer or
    configuration file.

  -x <example>   --example <example>
    Displays an example configuration file to standard output. Redirect this
    output to use as a starting point for a configuration.
